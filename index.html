            <h2>About</h2>

         <div>
            <p>Majority of my professional career has been in the IT sector, specifically around network and security, with more than 10 years in the WISP (Wireless ISP) sector. It is in this period that I came to realise the power of programming. The hardware side (networking etc.) and software (programming) go hand in hand, but it is particularly the flexibility around programming/coding that interest me. The manner in which to manipulate vast volumes of data and displaying it in a front end to maximise quality and efficiency of work is what gets me going. Recurring work can easily be automated. Work that would normally take hours to complete can be done in minutes with different options to present it in a front end, simplifying the presentation process to an audience.
I also have many years of backend and frontdesk IT support experience. I've worked in IT across various sectors, from the Film industry to Operations Manager in the ISP sector.

         <h2>Looking to The Future</h2>
            <p>In the near future everything will be automated. Automation can only be achieved through solid software code on the backend. Without software, the hardware cannot operate. So why not start your journey of automation, whether it be for your home or at your workplace, right now. We have the technical skills and aptitude to make a success of your project. 
More improtantly, we are still human and possess the necessary social skills to make any project a success.
